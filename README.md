# Copilot Working Group Workshops

Getting started:

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

This repository hosts hands-on workshops to learn and practice GitHub Copilot—using Copilot Chat in the GitHub UI, Copilot in VSCode, and custom agents.

## Workshops and Exercises

### Workshop 1: GitHub Copilot

#### Exercise 1: Create a test for `<ProductDetail />`

- Create an issue with Copilot to add a test that covers `<ProductDetail />`
- Assign Copilot to work on the issue
- Refine, collaborate and iterate with Copilot based on output

#### Exercise 2: Add Copilot Instructions

- Create Copilot instructions and Copilot setup to provide context to Copilot
- Specify preferred conventions and constraints relevant to the project (or pick your own!)
- Refine, collaborate and iterate with Copilot based on output

#### Exercise 3: Create a test for `dummyjson.service.ts`

- Prompt Copilot to add a test that covers `dummyjson.service.ts` with explicit prompt to follow black box testing methodology
- Refine, collaborate and iterate with Copilot to use `msw` to avoid mocking
- Update Copilot instructions to add context about using `msw`

#### Exercise 4: Participant's choice feature

- Implement a small feature (e.g., add cart persistence for items added to the cart across sessions) using Copilot via issues or agent delegation
- Refine, collaborate and iterate with Copilot based on output

### Workshop 2: VSCode Copilot

- Coming soon!

### Workshop 3: Custom Agents
